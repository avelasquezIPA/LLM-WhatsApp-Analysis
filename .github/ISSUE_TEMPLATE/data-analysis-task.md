## Objective

Brief description of the analysis task

## Data Requirements

    - [ ] Data access confirmed
- [ ] **Data quality verified**
    - [ ] Unique identifiers confirmed
    - [ ] Missing data patterns assessed
    - [ ] Outliers and data issues flagged

## Analysis Steps

- [ ] **Data cleaning completed**
    - [ ] Key verification passed (`verify_keys` function)
    - [ ] Data quality report generated
    - [ ] Cleaning script documented
- [ ] **Analysis script written**
    - [ ] Uses standardized functions from `functions.do`
    - [ ] Follows IPA coding standards
    - [ ] Includes defensive programming checks
- [ ] **Results generated**
    - [ ] Tables exported to `outputs/tables/`
    - [ ] Figures saved to `outputs/figures/`
    - [ ] All outputs reproducible

## Expected Outputs

- [ ] **Tables generated**:
    - [ ] [Specify table names]
- [ ] **Figures created**:
    - [ ] [Specify figure names]
- [ ] **Results documented**
    - [ ] Analysis interpretation written
    - [ ] Results validated by PI

## Quality Checks

- [ ] **Code quality verified**
    - [ ] `just lint-stata` passes without errors
    - [ ] Code follows style guidelines
    - [ ] Functions abstracted where appropriate
- [ ] **Pipeline testing completed**
    - [ ] `just stata-full` runs successfully
    - [ ] All outputs generated correctly
    - [ ] Results are reproducible

    - [ ] Documentation complete

## Deliverables

- [ ] Analysis script(s): `do_files/[script_name].do`
- [ ] Output tables: `outputs/tables/[table_files]`
- [ ] Output figures: `outputs/figures/[figure_files]`
- [ ] Documentation: [Brief summary or report section]
